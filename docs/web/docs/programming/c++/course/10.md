# 10. Version Control

We strongly recommend to at least read Chapter 1 and 2 of the [official Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and maybe the [seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).


## Setup for the First Time

    $ git config --global user.name lyrahgames
    $ git config --global user.email lyrahgames@mailbox.org
    $ git config --global core.editor nano

## New Project

    $ pwd
    /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course
    $ ls
    01-hello     02-input  03-fibonacci  04-files  05-rational
    06-graphics  07-build
    $ mkdir 08-git
    $ ls
    01-hello     02-input  03-fibonacci  04-files  05-rational
    06-graphics  07-build  08-git
    $ cd 08-git
    $ pwd
    /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course/08-git

## Git Initialization

    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course/08-git/.git/

Git created a new folder `.git` inside the current directory.
Because of the preceding dot, this folder is typically hidden.
To print it to the screen, we use an additional flag for `ls`.

    $ ls -a
    .git/

For now, the content of this folder is not interesting for us.

## Status

```
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

## Untracked Files

```
$ touch main.cpp
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    main.cpp

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

## Preparing for Commit

```
$ git add main.cpp
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
    new file:   main.cpp
```

## Commit

```
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
[master (root-commit) 63588d9] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 main.cpp
```

## Clean Repository and History

```
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

$ git log
commit 63588d9bb330ba9edb2d6f7bf664a445ec53a457 (HEAD -> master)
Author: lyrahgames <lyrahgames@mailbox.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 20 20:11:10 2020 +0200

    Initial commit
```

## Modified and Modified after Stage

```c++
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(){
  std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
}
```

    $ g++ -o hello main.cpp
    $ ./hello
    Hello, World!

```
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   main.cpp

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    hello

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

```
$ git add main.cpp
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   main.cpp

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    hello
```

Change `main.cpp` again before committing.

```c++
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(){
  using namespace std;
  cout << "Hello, World!\n";
}
```

```
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   main.cpp

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   main.cpp

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    hello
```

`git add` adds a snapshot of the file at the time the command was called.
If the file has changed after `git add`, it has to be added again.

```
$ git add main.cpp
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
    modified:   main.cpp

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    hello
```

Now let us do another commit.

    $ git commit

This one opens the `nano` editor.
Type in your commit message.

## Printing the Log

```
$ git log

## Checkout Other Commits

    $ git checkout 63588d

Return to the last commit.

    $ git checkout master

## Ignoring Specific Files: Black and White Listing

Let us now add a typical template `buildfile` from the last project to be able to automatically compile the program by using build2.

    $ touch buildfile

```
cxx.std = latest

using cxx

hxx{*}: extension = hpp
cxx{*}: extension = cpp

exe{hello}: {hxx cxx}{*}

cxx.poptions =+ "-I$src_base"
```

Test the compilation.

    $ b
    c++ cxx{main}
    ld exe{hello}
    $ ./hello
    Hello, World!

```
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    buildfile
    hello
    hello.d
    main.o
    main.o.d

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

From these given files, only `buildfile` should be tracked by Git.
To not always manually decide which files to add to the commit or the history, we will use a `.gitignore` file.

    $ touch .gitignore

Black listing approach: List every file or file pattern you do not want to track.

```
# .gitignore
hello
hello.d
main.o
main.o.d
```

with patterns:

```
# .gitignore
hello
*.d
*.o
```

Both of these files gives us the following output when `git status` is called.

```
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .gitignore
    buildfile

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Black listing, in my opinion is not ideal.
Therefore we will use white listing.
We will first ignore every possible file by using `*` and invert ignoring files by using `!`.

```
#.gitignore

# Ignore everything.
*

# Allow any subfolder.
!*/

# Allow C++ header and source files.
!*.hpp
!*.cpp

# Allow build2 buildfiles.
!buildfile

# Allow .gitignore file.
!.gitignore
```

Now make the commit by adding everything that is not ignored.

    $ git add .
    $ git commit
