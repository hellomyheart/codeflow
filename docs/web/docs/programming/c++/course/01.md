# Notes on C++ Course Lecture 1: Hello, World!

## Text Editor

To actually write C++ source code, we need a text editor.
We recommend to use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/).
The installations instructions for your Linux operating system can be found [here](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html).
Please, choose the appropriate package manager and follow the instructions.


## Hello, World!

Open the terminal.
You should be in your home directory.
Test this by using `pwd` like in the following case.

    $ pwd
    /home/lyrahgames

Create a folder where to store your course data and change the current directory to it.
Check again with `pwd`.

    $ mkdir -p projects/cpp-course
    $ cd projects/cpp-course
    $ pwd
    /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course

Create a folder for the first project in the course and change into it.

    $ mkdir 01-hello
    $ cd 01-hello
    $ pwd
    /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course/01-hello

Create a file by the following command and open your text editor in the course directory.

    touch main.cpp
    subl ..

Click on the created file `main.cpp` in the folder `01-hello` and type the following code.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "Hello, World!\n";
}
```

Make sure you have saved the changes.
You can even do this in the terminal by directly outputting the content of the file using the `cat` command.

    $ pwd
    /home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course/01-hello
    $ ls
    main.cpp
    $ cat main.cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    int main(){
        cout << "Hello, World!\n";
    }   

We compile the program in the same folder and run the created executable.

    $ g++ main.cpp
    $ ./a.out
    Hello, World!

## Why are doing this?

Every program consists of an input, work that has to be done, and output.
Without input and output, work that is done is useless.
In my experience, handling input and output will take up more than 80 % of your working time.
Only with proper input and output concepts, a program becomes usable and testable.
As a consequence, we first have to understand the basic input and output facilities in C++.

## Give Me Your Name and Age

Open a terminal or use an already opened terminal.
Go into the course folder and start a new project.

    $ cd ~/projects/cpp-course
    $ mkdir 02-input
    $ ls
    01-hello    02-input

Create a new `main.cpp` file.

    $ cd 02-input
    $ touch main.cpp
    $ ls
    main.cpp

Open Sublime Text and open the file `main.cpp` in the folder `02-input`.
Add the following lines.

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Please give me your name: ";

  string name;
  string surname;
  cin >> name;
  cin >> surname;

  cout << "Please give me your age: ";
  int age;
  cin >> age;

  cout << "Your name is '" << name << " " << surname << "'.\n"
       << "Your current age is " << age
       << " years and at your next birthday you will become " << age + 1
       << " years.\n";
}
```

We compile the program in the same folder and run the created executable.

    $ g++ main.cpp
    $ ./a.out
    Please give me your name: lyrah games
    Please give me your age: 123
    Your name is 'lyrah games'.
    Your current age is 123 years and at your next birthday you will become 124 years.

## Simple Idea of Types and Variables

In C++, objects and variables are synonyms.
The same holds for types, classes, and structures.
Every variable belongs to a unique type.
Types are only known to the compiler and vanish when the code is compiled.
Variables store actual data in memory in the form of binary numbers.
But the types tell us how to interpret those binary numbers.

Think of a mathematical expression like the following.
$$
x\in\mathbb{R}
$$
In this case, $x$ is a variable of the set $\mathbb{R}$.
We interpret $\mathbb{R}$ as the type of $x$.
So a type is more or less a set of all objects with certain constraints or requirements.
