## New Project Rational

This time our goal is it to create a new project which allows us to do computations with rational numbers.
C++ provides no built-in type able to store the value of rational number.
Instead C++ provides floating-point values which are able to approximate the value of rational numbers.
For example, the value $\frac{1}{3}$ cannot be represented by a floating-point value exactly.

A rational number $r\in\mathbb{Q}$ can always be represented by a fraction consisting of numbers $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $q\in\mathbb{N}$ such that the following equation holds.

\[
    r = \frac{p}{q}
\]

## Euclid's Algorithm

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)
[cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/gcd)

\[
    \mathrm{gcd}:\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}
\]

\[
    \mathrm{gcd}(x,0) = x
\]

\[
    \mathrm{gcd}(x,y) = \mathrm{gcd}(y, x\ \mathrm{mod}\ y)
\]

\[
    \mathrm{gcd}(x,x) = x
\]

\[
    \mathrm{gcd}(x,y) = 
    \begin{cases}
        \mathrm{gcd}(x-y,y) &: x > y \\
        \mathrm{gcd}(x,y-x) &: x < y
    \end{cases}
\]

```c++
// rational.hpp
unsigned int gcd(unsigned int x, unsigned int y);
```

```c++
// rational.cpp
unsigned int gcd(unsigned int x, unsigned int y){
  while(y != 0){
    auto tmp = y;
    y = x % y;
    x = tmp;
  }
  return x;
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <rational.hpp>

using namespace std;

int main(){
  for (int i = 1; i < 20; ++i)
    for (int j = 1; j < 20; ++j)
        cout << "gcd(" << i << ", " << j << ") = " << gcd(i,j) << '\n';
}
```

## Include Guard

```c++
// rational.hpp
#pragma once

unsigned int gcd(unsigned int x, unsigned int y);
```

## Inline

```c++
// rational.hpp

inline unsigned int gcd(unsigned int x, unsigned int y){
  while(y != 0){
    auto tmp = y;
    y = x % y;
    x = tmp;
  }
  return x;
}
```

## Starting with A Simple Structure

```c++
struct rational{
  int numerator;
  int denominator;
};
```
