## Solutions to the Exercises

### `!#c++ #include <...>` vs. `#!c++ #include "..."`

C++ provides too different ways of including a header file in a source file.
To include the C++ standard library for handling input and output on the terminal, we have done the following.

```c++
#include <iostream>
```

But to get the declaration of the function `gauss_sum` in the last project, we have chosen to use the following variant.

```c++
#include "gauss_sum.hpp"
```

Both of these variants are very similar.
If the given file could be found, they take the content of it and insert it at the exact position of the `#!c++ #include` directive.
The subtle difference of these two variants is the search algorithm that has to look for the given file.
By using tags in the form `#!c++ #include <...>`, the algorithm tries to find the given file in one of the standard include paths of the compiler.
By using quotes, the algorithm will first try to find the file in the current directory and if it could not find it, it looks in the standard include paths. 

### Adding a Factorial Function

```c++
// gauss_sum.hpp
int gauss_sum(int n);
int gauss_sum_eq(int n);
int factorial(int n);
```

```c++
// gauss_sum.cpp
int gauss_sum(int n) {
  int result = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    result = result + i;
  }
  return result;
}

int gauss_sum_eq(int n) {  //
  return n * n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

int factorial(int n){
  int result = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    result = result * i;
  }
  return result;
}
```

```c++
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "gauss_sum.hpp"

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Give me a number: \n";
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
    cout << i << "! = " << factorial(i) << '\n';
  }
}

```

## Compilation Process and Stages

For efficiently dealing with multiple files in a project, we will now take a deeper look into the actual compilation process and the different stages that are involved when we are calling the compiler on the command line.
The figure shown above demonstrates the compilation process for a project with two source files.
Possibly, they are both including some other header files, but as we have said, header files are not compiled but only included.

The first stage of the compiler process is called the preprocessor.
The processor acts without knowledge of the C++ syntax and only interchanges text strings based on the directives beginning with `#`.
For us, this means that every '#!c++ #include' directive is processed by the preprocessor.

After a source file has been preprocessed, the actual compiling will be done.
But after this step external structures or functions which were not defined in the current file are not yet resolved and kept as so-called symbols.
The resulting files are called object files and contain mostly binary code with a few symbols inside.

The last stage, called the linker, then resolves all symbols left and creates the actual binary file.

Please note, that only the linker needs all project files.
The other stages can be done in parallel.

## Setting Include Paths

Using two different inclusion schemes, has proven to be error-prone in my opinion.
Hence, we will strive for simplicity and only want to use the *library scheme*.

```c++
#include "gauss_sum.hpp"
```

```c++
#include <gauss_sum.hpp>
```

To validly transform the first directive to the second directive, we have to add the current path to the directory to standard include paths of the compiler.
For GCC, this can be done on the command line by adding the path after the flag `-I`.

    $ g++ -o gauss main.cpp gauss_sum.cpp -I.

From now on, every path given in an include directive has to be relative to the project root and not to the file itself.

## Errors in Different Stages

## Manual Compiling Process

```
$ pwd
/home/lyrahgames/projects/cpp-course/04-files
$ ls
main.cpp  gauss_sum.hpp  gauss_sum.cpp
$ g++ -c main.cpp -I.
$ g++ -c gauss_sum.cpp
$ g++ -o gauss main.o gauss_sum.o
$ # Ändern der gauss_sum.cpp
$ g++ -c gauss_sum.cpp
$ g++ -o gauss main.o gauss_sum.o
```

Tweaked usage with wildcards in the command line.

```
$ g++ -c *.cpp -I.
$ g++ -o gauss *.o
$ # Ändern der gauss_sum.cpp
$ g++ -c gauss_sum.cpp
$ g++ -o gauss *.o
```
